## Description
This website was a learning experience and test of my growing set of web development skills. I learned about anchor-links and used them to make a Nav bar. I learned how to embed filed into a webpage to display images and videos, as seen in the gallery and blog. I learned about styling in CSS and designed the website according to my color swatch and design documentation. I formatted the website for smart phones, tablets, and desktop screens using media screen states. The gallery and blog taught me the most about the concept of "The Box", how it works, and when to break it for design purposes. I also learned about forms and proper form submission practices which are utilized in the ConTact Me at the bottom of the page. Finally, the blog itself was about image hover effects and I demonstrated many common effects and methods of image hovering. 

## Color Swatch
<img src="./img/ColorSwatch.png">
This webpage follows the preceding color codes for its design. The greens are used to block out the divided sections of the webpage through background colors. The mint green as one exception, when it is being used as the font of elements using the dark brown as the background. The brown is used to denote interactive elements such as the buttons of the navbar or the submission button of the contact form. It is also used as the base font color for optimal contrast. Finally the orange is utilized for header backgrounds and border colors to cleanly mark different sections of the page alongside the shades of green. 

These colors were chosen for their high contrast with each other, so viewers have optimal legibility. This can be seen with the site logo
